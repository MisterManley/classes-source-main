# Shapes lab
The instructions for the lab are entirely in `exercises.js`. In addition to the instructions, there is a series of expectations for the code you will write. (Let's refer to a series of expectations like this as our "test suite".)They are all commented out at first, and you should uncomment them as you progress. You should not change any of the test suite. It is our finish line and we're running towards it; no moving the finish line allowed!
